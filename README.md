To run:

Locally:
* `cd ./server` and run `python api.py`
* `cd ./client` and run `python -m http.server`
* go to `http://localhost:8000` in browser

Extension:
* `cd ./server` and run `python api.py`
* go to `chrome://extensions`, click *Load Unpacked*, and open the `extension` folder. Switching extension on from here takes minimal savvy.
* go to any web page, the extension should automatically do its thing ...
